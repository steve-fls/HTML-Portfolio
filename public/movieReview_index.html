      This drama based on the New York ganks from the 1800s is has <br />
      an elite actor lineup who all bring their best to the film.
      <br />
      Great story lines with deep characters who realize themselves as the the
      <br />story unfolds. Bill, the Butcher is the main antoginist of the movie
      who is <br />
      one of my favorites in cinema being both each to hate and love at the same
      time.

      I am a big fan of the old classic love comedy. Its characters are fun and
      humor is <br />
      classy while simple. Its got a few great fight sequences which really just
      emphasis <br />the true talent of the actors themselves.

    <h3>Bullet-Train</h3>
    <p>Available on <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a></p>
    <p>
      This action comedy has a great cast with some extrodinary choices for
      certain roles. <br />The action is high impact while always being kept
      lowkey since everything is <br />happending on a plublic train. Great
      humor and great action sequences.
